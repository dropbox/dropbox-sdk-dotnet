# Dropbox.NET

A .NET SDK for integrating with the Dropbox API v2.

## Support Platforms
 - .NET Framework 4.5+
 - .NET Standard 2.0+
 
## Setup

To get started with Dropbox.NET, we recommend you add it to your project using NuGet.

To install `Dropbox.Api`, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```PM> Install-Package Dropbox.Api```

## Creating an application

You need to create an Dropbox Application to make API requests.

- Go to https://dropbox.com/developers/apps.

## Obtaining an access token

All requests need to be made with an OAuth 2 access token. To get started, once
you've created an app, you can go to the app's console and generate an access
token for your own Dropbox account.

You can also view our OAuth [guide](https://www.dropbox.com/lp/developers/reference/oauth-guide.html)

## Examples

Several examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/tree/master/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/Examples) directory:
* [SimpleTest](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/tree/master/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/Examples/SimpleTest) â€” A windows console application that demonstrates basic use of the SDK;
  this also contains code that connects with OAuth2 using WPF.
* [BasicOAuth](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/tree/master/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/Examples/OauthBasic) - A simple console application the demonstrates the basic oauth flows
* [PKCEOAuth](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/tree/master/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/Examples/OAuthPKCE) - A simple console application that demonstrates authentication via PKCE

## Documentation

You can find out more details in the [full documentation for the Dropbox.NET SDK](http://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-sdk-dotnet/html/R_Project_DotNetApiDocumentation.htm).

## Building from source
You can also build the SDK or create local nuget package from source code directly.
### Basic Setup

1. Prerequisites:
   - Visual Studio 2017 or above.
   - Python 2.7
   - [Optional] Sandcastle Help File Builder installed (https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases). This is only required for doc generation.

2. Clone the repository and update submodules.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-dotnet.git
   cd dropbox-sdk-dotnet
   git submodule init    
   git submodule update # also do this after every "git checkout" and "git pull"
   ```
3. Install stone and its dependencies by running
   ```
   cd stone
   python setup.py install
   ```

### Generate latest source code

1. Inside `dropbox-sdk-dotnet` repo, run `generate.py` script to generate class for latest data types. This will also generate all csproj files.
   ```
   python generate.py
   ```

2. Open up the `Dropbox.Api.sln` in Visual Studio and run
   the included examples as a sanity check.

### Create nuget package (This needs to be done on Windows)
1. Edit buildall.ps1 and update major version, release version and release notes.
2. In Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt run
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File buildall.ps1 -testSettings <PATH_TO_TEST_SETTINGS> 
   ```
   A .nukpg file will be generated in `Dropbox.Api` directory. Checkout [here](dropbox-sdk-dotnet/Dropbox.Api.Tests/dropbox.runsettings)
   for the format of test settings file.

### Generating Docs
1. In Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt, run
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File buildall.ps1 -testSettings <PATH_TO_TEST_SETTINGS> -doc
   ```
